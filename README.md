# Project 5 for Software Methodology Class

- **An efficient coffee and donut ordering platform empowering users to seamlessly customize their selections by adding various coffee options and an array of delectable donuts to their shopping cart. Our user-friendly system also grants the flexibility to remove items from the cart at will. Upon completing their order, customers can effortlessly place it and access a comprehensive order history view, where they can conveniently review all placed orders. Furthermore, they retain the option to delete orders from this order history view, providing an added level of control and convenience.**
